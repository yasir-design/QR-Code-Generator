# QR Code Generator using Docker and Python

Combining Docker with Python to create a program that generates a QR code PNG file that contains a URL. The QR code can be viewed with the camera on your phone to allow a user to click on it and send them to the target website. You must make your program generate a QR code that takes someone to the Docker Hub page for your image. You want to make it possible to change the QR code by using environment variables that can be overriden in the docker-compose.yml file. You also want to make sure that when you run the python script that it doesn't run as the root user. You will need to create a repository on Dockerhub to push the Docker image that this project generates.
